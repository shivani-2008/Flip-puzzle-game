# Flip-puzzle-game
It’s a browser-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The cards are laid out face down, and when you click on one, it flips to reveal an image or symbol. The challenge is to remember the positions of the cards and match them in pairs. If two flipped cards match, they stay open.
